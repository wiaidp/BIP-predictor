abstract = {Abstract Trend elimination and business cycle estimation are analyzed by finite sample and asymptotic methods. An overview history is provided, operator theory is developed, limit theory as the sample size is derived, and filtered series properties are studied relative to smoothing parameter () behavior. Simulations reveal that limit theory with delivers excellent approximations to the HP filter for common sample sizes but fails to remove stochastic trends, contrary to standard thinking in macroeconomics and thereby explaining “spurious cycle” effects of the HP filter. The findings are related to the long run effects of the global financial crisis.},

    abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

abstract = {Summary We propose a parsimonious semiparametric method for macroeconomic forecasting. Based on ideas of clustering and similarity, we partition the series into blocks, search for the closest blocks to the latest block of observations, and forecast with the matched blocks. In a real-time forecasting exercise, we show that our approach does especially well for labor market and other key macro variables. Our method outperforms parametric linear, nonlinear, time-varying, and combination forecasts for the period 1999–2015 and particularly in the Great Recession. When adding financial spreads, our method delivers further improvements for labor market variables and capacity utilization.},
